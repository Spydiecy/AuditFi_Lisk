## 🔥 Why AuditFi Will Change Everything

> **Traditional smart contract audits take weeks and cost thousands.** 
> 
> **AuditFi delivers enterprise-grade security analysis in under 30 seconds.**

**The Problem:** Developers deploy vulnerable contracts because security audits are too slow and expensive.

**Our Solution:** Instant, AI-powered security analysis that catches vulnerabilities before they cost millions.
